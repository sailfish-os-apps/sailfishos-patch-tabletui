Sailfish OS Tablet UI
=====================

It enables the Jolla Tablet-like Event view. It comes with three patches:

- Tablet UI: to show the Event view sidebar and a settings page to customize the numer of toggles displayed per row.
- Force large covers: to force large covers on the homescreen.
- Large padding in Launcher: increases the padding in the launcher.

Tip: for the best results, increase the Display pixel ratio (you can use my [UI Themer](https://fravaccaro.github.io/sailfishos-uithemer/)).

Thanks to Dax89, luca247 and AliNa for support and patience!
